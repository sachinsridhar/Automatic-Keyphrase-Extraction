On the main priority listing card, Do the numbers represent the importance of the priority, its ranking? If so, it seems to me like Microsoft should be in the number one priority based on more emails and a more recent upward trend. Do the priorities reorder themselves based on trends?Also the text below (which is unfortunately cut off here) says ‘green arrows’ and should probably read ‘green numbers’.On the individual priority card, there are two numbers under activity (42 emails and 57 total).The total number here does not match the email number from the first card. I assume this is a bug.What is the scope of the first number that it is less than the total? Is it the past week only? It might be good to put a qualifier in there to help not confuse people.I assume the gray band is the next upcoming meeting in that priority.Again, we might want to consider noting that so people know what it’s telling them.The date and time are wrong. It appears to only display the current date and time in GMT. I assume this is another bug.a. I assume I have two entries under one email because it was somehow split, correct? I can’t seem to find an email between just me and Vasyl on for this thread though.b. Similar to new priority notifications, should my name be appearing here or should it be omitted. I know it’s a lot of questions, so thanks in advance for your patience. Ryan',\n",

I watched it for a bit then I looked at Teams and it in fact was working fine. So it did work but as a user, I thought it did not….initially. Another point on the priority identification.    I got 3 recommended in this order     EY – I accepted     Royal Coffee – I accepted but I don’t understand why it came up. I have no meeting set up with them at all     Pressly – I did have one meeting set up and a few emails     It did not recommend Microsoft in the first 3 which is most alarming.

Pressly was one meeting and not more then 3 emails. Those 3 emails are in one chain. There is only one person on the Pressly email and meeting.

Something to keep in mind as we go through the next iteration of Q's design. You're right that if a target organization is already using Teams, then when they start using Q, the email traffic should be smaller. I'm mostly thinking about the initial experience, if they are new to both Q and Teams when we start working with them. Once they have put up with us for a while, they are more likely to stay.And hopefully not all of the 300 emails were priority communications, so our notifications will definitely present a smaller set. Still, we may ultimately need to become clever about which kinds of notifications we show even for accepted priorities or allow users to set manual filters if they want to. Best,AnupriyaFrom: \",\n",

For reference here is mine for today with numbers that correspond to my questions.    On the main priority listing card, Do the numbers represent the importance of the priority, its ranking? If so, it seems to me like Microsoft should be in the number one priority based on more emails and a more recent upward trend. Do the priorities reorder themselves based on trends?Also the text below (which is unfortunately cut off here) says ‘green arrows’ and should probably read ‘green numbers’.On the individual priority card, there are two numbers under activity (42 emails and 57 total).The total number here does not match the email number from the first card. I assume this is a bug.What is the scope of the first number that it is less than the total? Is it the past week only? It might be good to put a qualifier in there to help not confuse people.I assume the gray band is the next upcoming meeting in that priority.Again, we might want to consider noting that so people know what it’s telling them.The date and time are wrong. It appears to only display the current date and time in GMT. I assume this is another bug.a. I assume I have two entries under one email because it was somehow split, correct? I can’t seem to find an email between just me and Vasyl on for this thread though.b. Similar to new priority notifications, should my name be appearing here or should it be omitted.

Looks like we also have a lot discrepancies between what test generates and what production generates.The order of the priorities is switchedthe email count for 4tifier is different (both on the first overview card and the detailed card, test seems to have found 5 more emails the prod) the number of people in my 4tifier priority is differentAnd production truncates the list of people with what I assume are the number of people not listed, while test just has ellipses At this point, both Test and Production should have the same code so I can only assume this is a result of inconsistencies in the clustering algorithm.

       " 'Interesting information covering Teams From: Sherry HarmonSent: Thursday, March 16, 2017 8:47 AMTo: David Brunner (djb@moduleq.com) Subject: FW: BotBeat Weekly // Mar 16, 2017 DavidI am sure you got this, but read it!  Chat has been “weaponized” basically to kill smaller players like Slack. From: VentureBeat [mailto:info@venturebeat.com]Sent: Thursday, March 16, 2017 8:38 AMTo: Sherry Harmon Subject: BotBeat Weekly // Mar 16, 2017 NewsEvents Insight Dear Sherry, The enterprise chat wars are exploding. Last week, Google launched a beta version ofHangouts Chat and just two days ago, Microsoft released Teams in 181 countries and 19 languages. The moves by these 800 pound gorillas imperil companies like Slack, Yammer, and Hipchat -- the very companies that pioneered the enterprise chat space.Yet the giants are taking different approaches. With its 85 million Office 365 users, Microsoft has a ready-made market to sell its service. Companies wanting the chat and group collaboration functionality are going to have to pay. Google, asKen Yeung writes, is taking a page from Slack’s playbook by “establishing a platform to not only be a place to hold discussions, but to quickly jump into video calling when needed.” Hangouts Chat is marketed as a free service, available as part of companies’ G-suite subscriptions. So, a different approach to the same goal of charging businesses.Google and Microsoft are not alone in their enterprise focus. For instance, Facebook offers Workplace and Cisco has Spark. These big tech companies are now pushing enterprise chat and group collaboration, with bots as a service. Sure it’s an old war for enterprise market share, but now group chat has been weaponized to be integrated into an operating system and a host of applications. If that’s what determines victory, then perhaps first movers like Slacknever had a chance.As always, please send news tips to Khari Johnson and guest post submissions toJohn Brandon.

We're seeing lots of positive press about Teams. We've run into some issues with service URLs.  Could you please help us with the following questions? 1. We understand from the docs (https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/csharp/builder/sdkreference/routing.html) that service URLs should not be counted on to be stable. We are observing in production that they are not. Are they stable on a per user basis?2. If service URLs are stable on a per user basis, then we can save the service URL for each user, so that will work.  However, we have some users for whom we do not have working service URLs.  How can we obtain the service URLs for them? 3. If service URLs are not stable on a per user basis, how can we obtain the service URL when we get an error indicating that it has changed? Please note that our bot initiates communication with the user as external events warrant, so we cannot rely on an incoming message from the user to provide us with the updated service URL.

       " 'Hi Ryan,Yes, it is a bit of a mess right now with the priority ordering and the associated email and people. I myself am not clear on why those differences are there. As you said, luckily no one external is comparing. We need to fix these issues with the priority identification method. It will likely be broken for a bit, while David and I refine the new priority identification algorithm. I am going to implement it and compare it to Peter\\'s algorithm next week.Btw, the truncation was a fix I had put in and I\\'m impressed that it went to production, but not test.

Looks like we also have a lot discrepancies between what test generates and what production generates.The order of the priorities is switchedthe email count for 4tifier is different (both on the first overview card and the detailed card, test seems to have found 5 more emails the prod) the number of people in my 4tifier priority is differentAnd production truncates the list of people with what I assume are the number of people not listed, while test just has ellipses At this point, both Test and Production should have the same code so I can only assume this is a result of inconsistencies in the clustering algorithm. The bright side is no one but ModuleQ employees have access to both so they can’t compare and won’t notice. But it does reinforce that we’ll need to revise our algorithm at some point in the future.

Ryan From: Anupriya AnkolekarSent: Wednesday, March 15, 2017 6:36 PMTo: Ryan Curd Subject: Re: Morning Briefing questions Hi Ryan, No worries about the length, only got to it a bit later, cause I wanted to answer properly. :) 1. Yes, the order should correspond to their importance. The priorities currently do not reorder themselves, so they are in undefined order. Once the priority dashboard is in place, people will be able to reorder priorities and then this ranking should correspond to their user-defined ranking.a. It is indeed wrong and should say \"marked in green\", but the developers missed that new text I think. It is a simple fix in MQ.ai/moduleq/bot/views/templates/bulletin/summary.xml, so I will do it (has been on my todo list for a while.) 2. Yes and yes. Those numbers have been an issue. It should say 42 emails this week and 57 emails in total. That was specified originally, but got lost. The number 57 should appear in the summary view too. This is definitely a problem. The numbers are calculated differently: for the summary, it is read from the json query (I have to check how that is calculated), for the detail view, it is a sum of the numbers used to generate the activity graph. So, I guess they will always be close, but they really should be the same. 3. Yes, the upcoming meeting might be more obvious with a clear line saying \"Upcoming meeting\". I hadn\\'t noticed the date and time problems. They are definitely wrong and not having timezone there is an issue! 4. Just looks like a bug to me. Email addressees are not supposed to be split over two lines. I don\\'t see why that should happen. 5. Although this is a different case than new priority notifications, omitting the user\\'s name (which will always be present) saves space, so I suggest removing it here as well. That said, for new email notifications which contain a snippet of the new email, it made sense to keep the user in there, because there we\\'re presenting the email there as a purer object, which has the user as an attribute as well. That said, this is fuzzy reasoning, so I can be persuaded either way.  Btw, I can work on 1a, 2a, 3 and 4 (you won\\'t need to create separate JIRA items for each of them). Just let me know. Also, as a heads up, although not a prerequisite here, it would help immensely for design of the morning bulletin to look into headless Chrome (https://moduleq.atlassian.net/browse/MQ-503). This may be something for Vasily when he is relatively unburdened. Changing designs is onerous in our current setup, because the html rendering engine we use does not support the latest CSS standards. Both Nikolay and me have been reluctant (and slow) to make non-essential changes for this reason.  Best,Anupriya From: Ryan CurdSent: Wednesday, March 15, 2017 8:30:50 AMTo: Anupriya AnkolekarSubject: Morning Briefing questions Anupriya, I just had some questions about information in the morning briefing. For reference here is mine for today with numbers that correspond to my questions.    1.     On the main priority listing card, Do the numbers represent the importance of the priority, its ranking? If so, it seems to me like Microsoft should be in the number one priority based on more emails and a more recent upward trend. Do the priorities reorder themselves based on trends?a.     Also the text below (which is unfortunately cut off here) says ‘green arrows’ and should probably read ‘green numbers’.2.     On the individual priority card, there are two numbers under activity (42 emails and 57 total).a.     The total number here does not match the email number from the first card. I assume this is a bug.b.     What is the scope of the first number that it is less than the total? Is it the past week only? It might be good to put a qualifier in there to help not confuse people.3.     I assume the gray band is the next upcoming meeting in that priority.a.     Again, we might want to consider noting that so people know what it’s telling them.b.     The date and time are wrong. It appears to only display the current date and time in GMT. I assume this is another bug.4.     a. I assume I have two entries under one email because it was somehow split, correct? I can’t seem to find an email between just me and Vasyl on for this thread though.b. Similar to new priority notifications, should my name be appearing here or should it be omitted. I know it’s a lot of questions, so thanks in advance for your patience. Ryan',\n",

Chat has been “weaponized” basically to kill smaller players like Slack. From: VentureBeat [mailto:info@venturebeat.com]Sent: Thursday, March 16, 2017 8:38 AMTo: Sherry Harmon Subject: BotBeat Weekly // Mar 16, 2017 NewsEvents Insight Dear Sherry, The enterprise chat wars are exploding. Last week, Google launched a beta version ofHangouts Chat and just two days ago, Microsoft released Teams in 181 countries and 19 languages. The moves by these 800 pound gorillas imperil companies like Slack, Yammer, and Hipchat -- the very companies that pioneered the enterprise chat space.Yet the giants are taking different approaches. With its 85 million Office 365 users, Microsoft has a ready-made market to sell its service. Companies wanting the chat and group collaboration functionality are going to have to pay. Google, asKen Yeung writes, is taking a page from Slack’s playbook by “establishing a platform to not only be a place to hold discussions, but to quickly jump into video calling when needed.” Hangouts Chat is marketed as a free service, available as part of companies’ G-suite subscriptions. So, a different approach to the same goal of charging businesses.Google and Microsoft are not alone in their enterprise focus. For instance, Facebook offers Workplace and Cisco has Spark. These big tech companies are now pushing enterprise chat and group collaboration, with bots as a service. Sure it’s an old war for enterprise market share, but now group chat has been weaponized to be integrated into an operating system and a host of applications. If that’s what determines victory, then perhaps first movers like Slacknever had a chance.As always, please send news tips to Khari Johnson and guest post submissions toJohn Brandon.

Chat has been “weaponized” basically to kill smaller players like Slack. From: VentureBeat [mailto:info@venturebeat.com]Sent: Thursday, March 16, 2017 8:38 AMTo: Sherry Harmon Subject: BotBeat Weekly // Mar 16, 2017 NewsEvents Insight Dear Sherry, The enterprise chat wars are exploding. Last week, Google launched a beta version ofHangouts Chat and just two days ago, Microsoft released Teams in 181 countries and 19 languages. The moves by these 800 pound gorillas imperil companies like Slack, Yammer, and Hipchat -- the very companies that pioneered the enterprise chat space.Yet the giants are taking different approaches. With its 85 million Office 365 users, Microsoft has a ready-made market to sell its service. Companies wanting the chat and group collaboration functionality are going to have to pay. Google, asKen Yeung writes, is taking a page from Slack’s playbook by “establishing a platform to not only be a place to hold discussions, but to quickly jump into video calling when needed.” Hangouts Chat is marketed as a free service, available as part of companies’ G-suite subscriptions. So, a different approach to the same goal of charging businesses.Google and Microsoft are not alone in their enterprise focus. For instance, Facebook offers Workplace and Cisco has Spark. These big tech companies are now pushing enterprise chat and group collaboration, with bots as a service. Sure it’s an old war for enterprise market share, but now group chat has been weaponized to be integrated into an operating system and a host of applications. If that’s what determines victory, then perhaps first movers like Slacknever had a chance.As always, please send news tips to Khari Johnson and guest post submissions toJohn Brandon.

We're seeing lots of positive press about Teams. We've run into some issues with service URLs.  Could you please help us with the following questions? 1. We understand from the docs (https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/csharp/builder/sdkreference/routing.html) that service URLs should not be counted on to be stable. We are observing in production that they are not. Are they stable on a per user basis?2. If service URLs are stable on a per user basis, then we can save the service URL for each user, so that will work.  However, we have some users for whom we do not have working service URLs.  How can we obtain the service URLs for them? 3. If service URLs are not stable on a per user basis, how can we obtain the service URL when we get an error indicating that it has changed? Please note that our bot initiates communication with the user as external events warrant, so we cannot rely on an incoming message from the user to provide us with the updated service URL.

       " \"As @Richard mentioned, the general principle is to always reply with the serviceURL that’s provided in the incoming activity, instead of relying on cache. For proactively sending messages, it’s true that the bots might have to cache the service URL since there is no incoming activity to rely on.  Service URL should stay the same for one conversation (either 1:1 or group or channel conversation), and currently all conversations under the same tenant will actually have the same service URL. As I heard from @Jay, there might be a future plan to split a tenant to multiple regions, but no plan to split a team to multiple regions, so you can cache the service URL per team safely.

You’re a great partner! While I can’t say for sure, because this is about general skype plumbing, I believe the url varies based on data center being hit (emea vs us for example).  And therefore, you can’t count on it for the lifetime of the user.  Therefore, the best solution is to always reply with the ServiceURL you received.  For new message construction, I believe you can use the cached one, or the default smba.* @Jingjing Xia to keep me honest. Thanks all!-Rich From: Julian Morelli Sent: Thursday, March 16, 2017 1:00 PMTo: David Brunner ; Richard Moe Cc: Ryan Curd ; Anupriya Ankolekar ; Larry Jin Subject: RE: Issue RE service URLs in Teams +RichHey Rich, could you please take a look at this? From: David Brunner [mailto:djb@moduleq.com]Sent: Thursday, March 16, 2017 9:55 AMTo: Larry Jin ; Julian Morelli Cc: Ryan Curd ; Anupriya Ankolekar Subject: Issue RE service URLs in Teams Hi Larry and Julian, Hope everything is going great post GA!  We're seeing lots of positive press about Teams. We've run into some issues with service URLs.  Could you please help us with the following questions? 1. We understand from the docs (https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/csharp/builder/sdkreference/routing.html) that service URLs should not be counted on to be stable. We are observing in production that they are not. Are they stable on a per user basis?2. If service URLs are stable on a per user basis, then we can save the service URL for each user, so that will work.  However, we have some users for whom we do not have working service URLs.  How can we obtain the service URLs for them? 3. If service URLs are not stable on a per user basis, how can we obtain the service URL when we get an error indicating that it has changed? Please note that our bot initiates communication with the user as external events warrant, so we cannot rely on an incoming message from the user to provide us with the updated service URL. Thank you very much much for your help!

       " \"Hi David, Just curious, did you ever see cases where cached ServiceUrl value become invalid for a user? Since the service url will be consistent across the tenant, so if you have cached the url for other teams/users on the same tenant, it should work for this user. Regarding whether you can sequentially loop through all the regions, it’s possible, since we only have 3 regions (amer, emea, and apac) thus 3 service URLs as far as I know, but we might introduce more in the future, so I think it’s not a good idea to loop a static list.

       " 'Anupriya Thanks so much for alerting and including us in this conversation. It is an important decision and you had some very good ideas. I did want to spend a bit more time looking at search terms and what they bring up so that we can understand more clearly what they imply and who might be searching. Anupriya, David and Margo – Food for thought First of all we need to consider who we want to find us.  Do we want individuals in client facing roles or do we want executives who are interested in servicing better their client facing professionals? I still don’t believe that we can grow our company on individual users. That is because for client facing professionals this is a team sport with that individual managing a crowd of internal resources, not to mention their most important role, getting those resources to their customers. I do think we need to drive individual usage and have spent many years in the support arena doing just that. Driving individual users to adopt the knowledge transfer of information that connects to their customers’ specific issues. So let me tell you what I have learned.  I looked at Slack’s bot store and it has categories of  Analytics, Communication, Customer Support, Design, Developer Tools, File Management, Healthcare and Medical, HR, Marketing, Office Management, Payments and Accounting, Project Management, Sales, Security and Compliance, Social and Fun, Travel. Many of the Bot are listing in more than one category.  Bots that move email into Slack are listed in Communication and Customer Support. Sales has crossover to Project Management, Customer Support, Communications. As you can see this is pretty lite. None are really AI solutions. Here is a classification of bots.Good BotsChatbotsCrawlersTransactional botsInformational botsEntertainment bots: Art bots, Game botsBad BotsHackersSpammersScrapersImpersonators I think Q is a transactional bot which is Business Process Automation according to the article I read.  I agree with that. Q is going to be an informational bot also but still in a Business Process Automation way of delivery. Knowledge Delivery, I am laying all of this out because ModuleQ is disruptive and does not fit into a category. For that reason we need to enforce our own language but also go after budgets for projects that overlap what we do.Examples of nearby target budgets are –Knowledge ManagementKnowledge TransferEmail managementInformation managementBusiness Process Automation Some of these are very large categories with big vendors. Those should be where we go. I like the term Knowledge Delivery but Google it. Surprise,,on the first page you get lots of learning solutions, many for K through 12.Also you will see ModuleQ right near the top! Knowledge Transfer brings up all of the support automation solutions which do what we do but are specific to Support organizations and react to the categories in a user’s issue. It does not use machine learning or AI, but these are companies to watch out for. Anyway, I wouldn’t use that term. I am pondering these –Knowledge Delivery – still like it except for the K-12 solutions.AI Information Delivery – we do deliver cross silo information including email and calendar someday.Business Process Bot – This is way at the top and seems out of reach because it must include both internal and external focus individuals and teams. But Wow!, that could be a someday thing. So you can see that I am not a proponent of adopting an existing category because I don’t think having individuals find us is so important. Anupriya, I like what you came up with but needed to think about this.Be warned these are all opinions but based in having taken disruptive solutions to market for years. You should weigh in with your thoughts!  ',\n",

       " \"Hi David,Yes, that would make sense and the user would have a more direct path to having Q show up in Teams. However, rather than showing our website with the link to join in Teams [1], which looks rather broken if you access it without logging in, perhaps we can directly use the link to chat with Q [2]. Clicking on this should add Q to the user's Teams account (not sure what happens if the user doesn't have Teams) and that should trigger a conversationUpdate and our Hi there message. The only downside is that Q's first message contains a rather terse explanation of what it does. So, we'd have to rely on the search description having everything useful about Q. Also, I just noticed now that q.moduleq.com doesn't have a link back to moduleq.com. If the user lands at the former q.moduleq.com link, they'll probably not find our primary website.I am not sure if the provider title (CNN) on the picture Julian sent us is actually a link.If they had added the bot through the bot discovery process within Teams, they would see the moduleq.com provider link. So, if preparing the user is important, then it might be best to start with q.moduleq.com, else the bot chat link itself might make sense. Let me know what you think ...For the future, I do think we need to work on the landing page for a simple bot link that adds Q to Teams. Perhaps this can be part of the moduleq.com website and redirects to q.moduleq.com only when the user hits the Engage Q button.

We need to think about how to show this information. I hold in my head only admin panel as instrument to show it. or use tools to get access to data base. These are mostly facts we know but backed up here. It is good coverage of MSFT Teams.\",\n",
    "\n",
    " \"It is a useful number. Some people that we have spoken to get more then 300 a day. Those were typically consulting or sales managers. Of course many of those were internal emails because they worked in large organizations. By this article internal email volume decreased also. Teams makes that happen. We improve the experience in Teams with external emails by surfacing priority communications.\",\n",

    " \"My experience. I had to delete Steve Vigo as I noticed he got in the way. MSFT needs to sort that out. Once I signed into Teams and engaged it did the binding which just spun. I watched it for a bit then I looked at Teams and it in fact was working fine. So it did work but as a user, I thought it did not ... initially. Another point on the priority identification. I got 3 recommended in this order - EY – I accepted Royal Coffee – I accepted but I don’t understand why it came up. I have no meeting set up with them at all. Pressly – I did have one meeting set up and a few emails. It did not recommend Microsoft in the first 3 which is most alarming. I have meetings set up in the near past and future and lots of emails with them. It is most of my email traffic.\",\n",

I have no meeting set up with them and I haven't had a meeting for maybe 4 months … or more.  Microsoft should have been right below EY or ahead of EY and it didn't show up in the first 3. Pressly was one meeting and not more then 3 emails. Those 3 emails are in one chain. There is only one person on the Pressly email and meeting. There are many people on the EY and MSFT meetings and emails. So it seems a little random to me.\",\n",

    " \"Interesting! ... Now I do remember your mentioning this number before for consulting and sales managers. The magnitude of that wrt how Q will perform is now starting to sink in for me. Something to keep in mind as we go through the next iteration of Q's design. You're right that if a target organization is already using Teams, then when they start using Q, the email traffic should be smaller. I'm mostly thinking about the initial experience, if they are new to both Q and Teams when we start working with them. Once they have put up with us for a while, they are more likely to stay.And hopefully not all of the 300 emails were priority communications, so our notifications will definitely present a smaller set. Still, we may ultimately need to become clever about which kinds of notifications we show even for accepted priorities or allow users to set manual filters if they want to.\",\n",

    " \"Hi Ryan, No worries about the length, only got to it a bit later, cause I wanted to answer properly. :) 1. Yes, the order should correspond to their importance. The priorities currently do not reorder themselves, so they are in undefined order. Once the priority dashboard is in place, people will be able to reorder priorities and then this ranking should correspond to their user-defined ranking.a. It is indeed wrong and should say 'marked in green', but the developers missed that new text I think. It is a simple fix in MQ.ai/moduleq/bot/views/templates/bulletin/summary.xml, so I will do it (has been on my todo list for a while.)2. Yes and yes. Those numbers have been an issue. It should say 42 emails this week and 57 emails in total. That was specified originally, but got lost. The number 57 should appear in the summary view too. This is definitely a problem. The numbers are calculated differently: for the summary, it is read from the json query (I have to check how that is calculated), for the detail view, it is a sum of the numbers used to generate the activity graph. So, I guess they will always be close, but they really should be the same.3. Yes, the upcoming meeting might be more obvious with a clear line saying 'Upcoming meeting'. I hadn\\'t noticed the date and time problems. They are definitely wrong and not having timezone there is an issue!4. Just looks like a bug to me. Email addressees are not supposed to be split over two lines. I don\\'t see why that should happen.5. Although this is a different case than new priority notifications, omitting the user\\'s name (which will always be present) saves space, so I suggest removing it here as well. That said, for new email notifications which contain a snippet of the new email, it made sense to keep the user in there, because there we\\'re presenting the email there as a purer object, which has the user as an attribute as well. That said, this is fuzzy reasoning, so I can be persuaded either way.Btw, I can work on 1a, 2a, 3 and 4 (you won\\'t need to create separate JIRA items for each of them). Just let me know.Also, as a heads up, although not a prerequisite here, it would help immensely for design of the morning bulletin to look into headless Chrome (https://moduleq.atlassian.net/browse/MQ-503). This may be something for Vasily when he is relatively unburdened. Changing designs is onerous in our current setup, because the html rendering engine we use does not support the latest CSS standards. Both Nikolay and me have been reluctant (and slow) to make non-essential changes for this reason. Morning Briefing questions Anupriya, I just had some questions about information in the morning briefing. For reference here is mine for today with numbers that correspond to my questions. On the main priority listing card, Do the numbers represent the importance of the priority, its ranking?
